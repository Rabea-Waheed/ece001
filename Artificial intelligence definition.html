<h1>What's Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<h2><div>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition and machine vision.
Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.

<p><h2>The computer scientist John McCarthy coined the term Artificial Intelligence in 1956, and defines the field of artificial intelligence as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.”

As well as the term for the scientific discipline, artificial intelligence refers to the intelligence of a machine, program, or system, in contrast to that of human intelligence.

Alessandro Annoni, the head of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, spoke at the Science Meets Parliaments conference at the European Parliament, Brussels in February 2019. He said: “Artificial intelligence should not be considered a simple technology…it is a collection of technologies. It is a new paradigm that is aiming to give more power to the machine. It’s a technology that will replace humans in some cases.”</p></h2>
