<h2><div>The history of artificial intelligence dates back to antiquity with philosophers mulling over the idea that artificial beings, mechanical men, and other automatons had existed or could exist in some fashion.

Thanks to early thinkers, artificial intelligence became increasingly more tangible throughout the 1700s and beyond. Philosophers contemplated how human thinking could be artificially mechanized and manipulated by intelligent non-human machines. The thought processes that fueled interest in AI originated when classical philosophers, mathematicians, and logicians considered the manipulation of symbols (mechanically), eventually leading to the invention of a programmable digital computer, the Atanasoff Berry Computer (ABC) in the 1940s. This specific invention inspired scientists to move forward with the idea of creating an “electronic brain,” or an artificially intelligent being.

Nearly a decade passed before icons in AI aided in the understanding of the field we have today. Alan Turing, a mathematician among other things, proposed a test that measured a machine’s ability to replicate human actions to a degree that was indistinguishable from human behavior. Later that decade, the field of AI research was founded during a summer conference at Dartmouth College in the mid-1950s, where John McCarthy, computer and cognitive scientist, coined the term “artificial intelligence.”

From the 1950s forward, many scientists, programmers, logicians, and theorists aided in solidifying the modern understanding of artificial intelligence as a whole. With each new decade came innovations and findings that changed people’s fundamental knowledge of the field of artificial intelligence and how historical advancements have catapulted AI from being an unattainable fantasy to a tangible reality for current and future generations.
<h2>AI from 1900-1950</h2>
1921: Karel Čapek, a Czech playwright, released his science fiction play “Rossum’s Universal Robots” (English translation). His play explored the concept of factory-made artificial people who he called robots – the first known reference to the word. From this point onward, people took the “robot” idea and implemented it into their research, art, and discoveries.
<h2>AI in the 1950s</h2>
1950: Claude Shannon, “the father of information theory,” published “Programming a Computer for Playing Chess,” which was the first article to discuss the development of a chess-playing computer program.
1950: Alan Turing published “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” which proposed the idea of The Imitation Game – a question that considered if machines can think. This proposal later became The Turing Test, which measured machine (artificial) intelligence. Turing’s development tested a machine’s ability to think as a human would. The Turing Test became an important component in the philosophy of artificial intelligence, which discusses intelligence, consciousness, and ability in machines.
<h2>AI in the 1960s</h2>
1961: Unimate, an industrial robot invented by George Devol in the 1950s, became the first to work on a General Motors assembly line in New Jersey. Its responsibilities included transporting die castings from the assembly line and welding the parts on to cars – a task deemed dangerous for humans.
<h2>AI in the 1970s</h2>
1970: WABOT-1, the first anthropomorphic robot, was built in Japan at Waseda University. Its features included moveable limbs, ability to see, and ability to converse.
<h2>AI in the 1980s</h2>
1980: WABOT-2 was built at Waseda University. This inception of the WABOT allowed the humanoid to communicate with people as well as read musical scores and play music on an electronic organ.
<h2>AI in the 1990s</h2>
The end of the millennium was on the horizon, but this anticipation only helped artificial intelligence in its continued stages of growth.

1995: Computer scientist Richard Wallace developed the chatbot A.L.I.C.E (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity), inspired by Weizenbaum's ELIZA. What differentiated A.L.I.C.E. from ELIZA was the addition of natural language sample data collection.
